## About

This project is the creation of a reddit style Gif search website. When first accessing the website, there are 10 gifs that are automatically displayed. Then, the user can search for a specific gif by typing something into the search bar, and 10 gifs related to that search word will be displayed.

## Demo





We would like to thank Dani for explaining the concepts of this challenge and helping us understand where we had to go with it. We would also like to give credit to DarkCode for helping us find an idea of how we wanted our search box to look like with the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1PeTDrw6OY". Thank you to Ben Laferty for their help with minor errors.
