This is the joint project for Ariane and Christian.

We would like to thank Dani for explaining the concepts of this challenge and helping us understand where we had to go with it. We would also like to give credit to DarkCode for helping us find an idea of how we wanted our search box to look like with the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1PeTDrw6OY". Thank you to Ben Laferty for their help with minor errors.
